# 🌟 Interactive Story Game – How to Add a New Scene

Welcome! This guide will help you add a new scene to the story. You don’t need any coding experience — just follow the steps below carefully.

---

## 📁 Where Scenes Are Stored

All scenes are written in **Markdown (.md) files** and saved inside folders like:
- `docs/character 1/`
- `docs/character 2/`
- `docs/character 3/`

Each folder has scenes for that character. Each scene is one `.md` file.

---

## ✍️ How to Add a New Scene

### 1. Go to the Character Folder

Click on the character's folder in GitHub:
- `Character 1/` for Character One's scenes
- `Character 2/` for Character Two's scenes
- `Character 3/` for Character Three's scenes

---

### 2. Click **"Add file"** → **"Create new file"**

Name your file something like:
- `character1-11.md`

Replace `character1` with the character’s name, and pick the next available scene number.

---

### 3. Paste This Template Into the File

```markdown
---
id: character1-11
title: A New Beginning
choices:
  - Investigate the noise => character1-12
  - Hide in the shadows => character1-13
  - Run down the hallway => character1-14
  - Wait and listen => character1-15
---

You finds yourself in a dim hallway. The lights flicker above your head...
```
